R code for cluster analysis homogeneity statistics

The R code that generates estimates of the Bergman Homogeneity Statistic.
The statistic is computed as a comparison of explained variance to total variance.
The technical details of the computation of this statistic will follow in a coming commit.
The included code as of 2018-12-21 contains a file with an example of its use along with an R script that can be used to compute this statistic yourself. 
If you are interested in this statistic, I would suggest referring to the Bergman, Magnusson and El-Khoun text 'Studying Individual Development in an Interindividual Context' for more details.
This statistic is labeled EV in that text. 

Future additions will address any bug fixes that may occur as the code is very restrictive of what forms can be input to return a result. 
Please feel free to contact me if you have any issues.
